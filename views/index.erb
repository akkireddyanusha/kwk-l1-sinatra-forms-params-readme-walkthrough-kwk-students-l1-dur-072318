<input>As far as you know today, this is your one and only life. If you live to age ninety, figure out how many days left you have to live. Really, add it up. You have a limited number of days, so do you want to waste one of them feeling bad about yourself and not demanding the best life has to offer? Do you really want to let others determine how you will live, or give away your precious life to fear?Sometimes we lack self-esteem because we've messed up in some way and therefore view ourselves as “worth less.” We think we're worth less because we aren't perfect. But anyone who is successful will tell you they reached success on the stepping stones of failure and screw-ups. Mistakes and failure reveal a willingness to take risk and try.Rather than ruminating on how bad you feeling about yourself, do something positive and productive. This is particularly effective if the action you take relates to improving the area where you feel low self-esteem. If you're feeling bad about your weight for example, go take a walk or exercise in some way. Action makes you feel in control of your destiny.
